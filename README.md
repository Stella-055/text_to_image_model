# Text-to-Image Generation using Stable Diffusion and Diffusers

## Overview
This project demonstrates the process of generating images using Stable Diffusion models via the Diffusers library from Hugging Face. The implementation utilizes pre-trained models to create high-quality images from textual descriptions.

## Features
- Utilizes Hugging Face's Diffusers library for stable diffusion models.
- Supports different Stable Diffusion models, including Dreamlike-Diffusion and Stable Diffusion XL.
- Enables customization of prompts for unique and creative image generation.
- Allows setting parameters such as inference steps, image dimensions, number of images per prompt, and negative prompts for refined results.
- Leverages GPU acceleration using PyTorch for improved performance.

## Models Used
- **Dreamlike-Diffusion 1.0** (dreamlike-art/dreamlike-diffusion-1.0): A model designed for artistic and dreamlike image outputs.
- **Stable Diffusion XL Base 1.0** (stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0): A high-quality diffusion model for generating realistic images.

## Customization Options
### Prompt Engineering
Users can input descriptive prompts to guide the image generation process. The prompt structure significantly affects the final output, allowing for dynamic and creative results.

### Adjustable Parameters
- **Negative Prompting**: Helps exclude unwanted characteristics from generated images.
- **Number of Inference Steps**: Determines the level of detail and refinement in the generated images.
- **Image Dimensions**: Users can set custom height and width values for image generation.
- **Number of Images Per Prompt**: Generates multiple variations of an image from a single prompt.

## Applications
- Concept art and creative illustrations
- AI-assisted design and visualization
- Image augmentation for various creative projects
- Enhancing storytelling with AI-generated imagery
